# Interactive speech-based Form filling in  native language
I worked on this project in correspondance with Yaadhum Oore Global Conclave Hackathon conducted by Government of Tamilnadu along with IEEE.
## Working
* This project works with Google Speech API as a backbone.
* We have used some basic OCR tools to read the input fields from the form.
* The collected OCR data is used to generate the digital form which the user will be interacting with.
## Targeted users
* Uneducated people from rural places.
* Everyone who wishes to simplify the process of form-filling.
## Team
* Sanjay T (Myself)
* Jayanth Vikash S
